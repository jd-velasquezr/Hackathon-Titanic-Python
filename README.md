# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction — Hackathon Project

## 🧭 Overview  
The sinking of the **Titanic** remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the so-called “unsinkable” RMS Titanic struck an iceberg and tragically sank. Due to an insufficient number of lifeboats, **1,502 of the 2,224 passengers and crew lost their lives**.

This project aims to answer a compelling question:  
**"What kinds of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?"**  

Using data about the passengers — including name, age, gender, socioeconomic class, and more — we build a predictive model to shed light on the key factors that influenced survival outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset  
The analysis is based on the **classic Titanic dataset**, which contains detailed information about each passenger, including demographic attributes and survival status.

## 🧱 Project Structure  

The project is organized into the following components:

### 🔍 Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Handle missing values
- Normalize and clean data for modeling

### 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Create new relevant features
- Transform existing features (e.g., categorical encoding)
- Optimize features for better predictive accuracy

### 🧠 Model Building
- Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Train models on the processed data
- Perform hyperparameter tuning

### 📈 Model Evaluation
- Measure performance using metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
- Compare models to select the best-performing one

### 📌 Conclusion
- Summarize key findings
- Identify the most impactful factors in determining survival
- Reflect on model performance and possible improvements
