🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction — Hackathon Project
🧭 Overview
The sinking of the Titanic remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the so-called “unsinkable” RMS Titanic struck an iceberg and tragically sank. Due to an insufficient number of lifeboats, 1,502 of the 2,224 passengers and crew lost their lives.

This project aims to answer a compelling question:
"What kinds of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?"

Using data about the passengers — including name, age, gender, socioeconomic class, and more — we build a predictive model to shed light on the key factors that influenced survival outcomes.

📊 Dataset
The analysis is based on the classic Titanic dataset, which contains detailed information about each passenger, including demographic attributes and survival status.

🧱 Project Structure
This project is organized into the following key components:

🔍 Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Initial data inspection, handling of missing values, and preparation of the dataset for analysis.

🛠️ Feature Engineering
Creation of new features and transformation of existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.

🧠 Model Building
Implementation of machine learning algorithms to construct a predictive model based on the cleaned dataset.

📈 Evaluation
Assessment of model performance using multiple metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

📌 Conclusion
Summary of insights, highlighting the most influential factors that determined a passenger’s chances of survival.
